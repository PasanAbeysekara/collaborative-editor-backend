This repository contains the backend for a cloud-native, real-time collaborative document editor, inspired by applications like Google Docs. It is engineered with a **production-grade microservice architecture** using Go, containerized with Docker, and orchestrated with **Kubernetes**. The system provides a robust foundation for building scalable, resilient, and observable distributed systems.

## Core Concepts & Architectural Philosophy

This project serves as a practical, hands-on implementation of modern cloud-native principles.

*   **Microservice Architecture:** The application is decomposed into independent services (`user`, `document`, `realtime`), each with a distinct business capability. This allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling.
*   **Container Orchestration:** We've moved beyond `docker-compose` to **Kubernetes** to manage the application's lifecycle. This provides production-level features like self-healing, automated rollouts, and declarative configuration.
*   **Declarative Infrastructure:** All application components, from the services themselves to the databases and networking rules, are defined as code in Kubernetes YAML manifests.
*   **Observability as a First-Class Citizen:** The system is built with a pre-configured, powerful observability stack (**Prometheus, Loki, Grafana**). This provides immediate, centralized insight into the health, performance, and behavior of all services, which is non-negotiable in a microservice environment.
*   **API Gateway Pattern:** An **NGINX Ingress Controller** acts as the single, unified entry point for all external traffic, handling routing, SSL termination (in a real production setup), and abstracting the internal service topology from the outside world.

## Features

*   **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using JWT.
*   **Document Management**: Create and manage documents, with ownership assigned to users.
*   **Secure Document Sharing**: Owners can securely share documents with other registered users via an access control list.
*   **Real-time Collaboration Engine**:
    *   Stateful WebSocket connections managed on a per-document basis.
    *   Operations-based synchronization (`insert`/`delete`/`undo` operations).
    *   Sequential consistency enforced by a document versioning system.
    *   High-speed session state management and operation history using **Redis**.
*   **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Fully orchestrated with **Kubernetes**, including a production-style Ingress for traffic management.
*   **Full Observability Stack**: Centralized logging and metrics out-of-the-box with **Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana**.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to deploy the entire microservice stack to a local Kubernetes cluster.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following tools installed and configured on your system:

*   **Docker:** To build and run containers.
*   **Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`):** To interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Minikube:** To run a local Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Helm:** The package manager for Kubernetes.
*   A WebSocket client like `wscat` (`npm install -g wscat`).
*   A tool for making API requests like `curl`.
*   `jq`: A command-line JSON processor, useful for scripting tests.

### Deployment Instructions

**1. Start the Kubernetes Cluster**

Initialize your local Minikube cluster and enable the Ingress addon, which will act as our API Gateway.
```sh
minikube start
minikube addons enable ingress
```

**2. Configure Environment Variables**

The application's sensitive configuration is managed via a Kubernetes Secret, which is generated from a local `.env` file.

```sh
# Create your local configuration file from the example
cp .env.local .env
```
**IMPORTANT:** Open the newly created `.env` file and:
1.  Replace the placeholder `DATABASE_URL` with your **actual remote PostgreSQL connection string**.
2.  Change `JWT_SECRET` to a long, unique, and random string for security.

**3. Build and Load Docker Images**

This crucial command configures your local Docker client to communicate with the Docker daemon running *inside* the Minikube cluster. This allows you to build images directly into its environment, making them accessible to Kubernetes without needing an external registry.

```sh
# For Linux/macOS
eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)

# For Windows PowerShell: & minikube -p minikube docker-env | Invoke-Expression

# Build the images for each microservice
docker build -t user-service:v1 -f ./cmd/user-service/Dockerfile .
docker build -t document-service:v1 -f ./cmd/document-service/Dockerfile .
docker build -t realtime-service:v1 -f ./cmd/realtime-service/Dockerfile .
```

**4. Deploy the Application to Kubernetes**

Apply the Kubernetes manifests to create all application resources.
```sh
# Create the Kubernetes Secret from your .env file
kubectl apply -f k8s/secrets.yaml

# Deploy Redis, our 3 services, and the Ingress routing rules
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```
Verify that all application pods are running successfully:
```sh
kubectl get pods
```

**5. Deploy the Observability Stack**

Use Helm to deploy the Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana stack into your cluster.
```sh
# Add the required Helm repositories
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

# Install the charts
helm install loki-stack grafana/loki-stack
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
helm install grafana grafana/grafana
```
Wait for all observability pods (`loki-stack-`, `prometheus-`, `grafana-`) to enter the `Running` state.

---

## Testing the System

All interaction with the application now goes through the Minikube Ingress IP.

**1. Get the Application Entry Point**
```sh
export MINIKUBE_IP=$(minikube ip)
echo "Application is accessible at: http://$MINIKUBE_IP"
```

**2. Run the Automated End-to-End Test Script**

The following script will:
1.  Register two users.
2.  Log them in and extract their JWTs.
3.  Create a new document as User A.
4.  Share the document with User B.
5.  Print the exported variables needed for the manual WebSocket test.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
export MINIKUBE_IP=$(minikube ip)

echo "--- 1. Registering Users ---"
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"owner@example.com", "password":"password123"}' http://$MINIKUBE_IP/auth/register
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"collab@example.com", "password":"password123"}' http://$MINIKUBE_IP/auth/register

echo -e "\n--- 2. Logging in Users ---"
export TOKEN_A=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"owner@example.com", "password":"password123"}' http://$MINIKUBE_IP/auth/login | jq -r .token)
export TOKEN_B=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"collab@example.com", "password":"password123"}' http://$MINIKUBE_IP/auth/login | jq -r .token)

echo "--- 3. Creating Document ---"
export DOCUMENT_ID=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_A" -d '{"title":"Live Test Doc"}' http://$MINIKUBE_IP/documents | jq -r .ID)

echo "--- 4. Sharing Document ---"
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_A" -d '{"email":"collab@example.com", "role":"editor"}' http://$MINIKUBE_IP/documents/$DOCUMENT_ID/share

echo -e "\n\nâœ… Setup Complete! Use these exported variables for WebSocket testing:"
echo "------------------------------------------------------------------"
echo "export MINIKUBE_IP=$MINIKUBE_IP"
echo "export DOCUMENT_ID=$DOCUMENT_ID"
echo "export TOKEN_A=$TOKEN_A"
echo "export TOKEN_B=$TOKEN_B"
echo "------------------------------------------------------------------"
```

**3. Manual WebSocket Test**

*   **Test Real-Time Editing:**
    Open two terminals. In Terminal 1, connect as User A. In Terminal 2, connect as User B. (Requires `wscat` and `jq` to be installed).

    *   **Terminal 1 (User A):**
        ```sh
        wscat -c "ws://$MINIKUBE_IP/ws/doc/$DOCUMENT_ID" --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_A"
        ```
    *   **Terminal 2 (User B):**
        ```sh
        wscat -c "ws://$MINIKUBE_IP/ws/doc/$DOCUMENT_ID" --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_B"
        ```
    *   In Terminal 1, send an `insert` operation. You should see it appear in Terminal 2.
        ```json
        { "type": "insert", "pos": 0, "text": "Hello world", "version": 0 }
        ```
    *   In Terminal 2, send an `undo` operation. Both terminals should receive a `delete` operation from the server.
        ```json
        { "type": "undo" }
        ```

## Accessing the Observability Dashboard (Grafana)

1.  **Get the Grafana Admin Password:**
    ```sh
    kubectl get secret grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo
    ```
2.  **Access the UI:**
    Open a new terminal and run this command to forward the port.
    ```sh
    kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80
    ```
    Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` and log in with username `admin` and the retrieved password.

3.  **Configure Data Sources:**
    *   Navigate to **Connections -> Data Sources**.
    *   **Add Prometheus:** URL: `http://prometheus-server:80`
    *   **Add Loki:** URL: `http://loki-stack:3100`

You can now use the **Explore** tab to view logs from all services (via Loki) and performance metrics (via Prometheus).

## Roadmap / Future Work

-   [ ] **Phase 3: Distributed Tracing**: Instrument services with OpenTelemetry and deploy Jaeger to visualize request flows across the microservice architecture.
-   [ ] **Phase 4: Resilience Patterns**: Implement Circuit Breakers in the `realtime-service` to gracefully handle failures or slowdowns in the `document-service`.
-   [ ] **Phase 4: Event-Driven Architecture**: Decouple services further by introducing a message broker like NATS for asynchronous communication (e.g., publishing a `DocumentUpdated` event instead of a synchronous save).
-   [ ] **Full OT Algorithm**: Implement a complete Operational Transformation (OT) algorithm to resolve concurrent editing conflicts instead of simple version rejection.

## Cleaning Up

```sh
# Delete all Kubernetes resources from your manifests
kubectl delete -f k8s/

# Uninstall the Helm charts
helm uninstall loki-stack grafana prometheus

# Stop the Minikube cluster
minikube stop
```
