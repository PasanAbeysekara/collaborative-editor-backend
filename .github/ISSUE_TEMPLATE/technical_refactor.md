**What part of the codebase does this proposal target?**
Please be specific, including file paths. *(e.g., `internal/realtime/hub.go` and the `run()` function.)*

**Describe the current implementation and its limitations**
A clear description of how the code works today and why it could be improved.
*(e.g., "Currently, the hub's `run()` function contains all logic for handling different operation types (insert, delete, undo). As we add more types like 'redo', this function will become very large and hard to maintain.")*

**Describe the proposed improvement and its benefits**
A clear description of the new implementation and why it's better.
*(e.g., "I propose creating a strategy pattern. We can have an `OperationHandler` interface with an `Execute` method. We can then create concrete handlers like `InsertHandler`, `DeleteHandler`, and `UndoHandler`. This will make the hub's `run()` function much cleaner and make adding new operations trivial.")*

**Potential risks or side effects**
What could go wrong? What needs careful testing after this change?
*(e.g., "This is a significant refactor of the core logic. All existing tests for insert, delete, and undo must pass. We need to be careful about how state (like `version` and `content`) is passed to the handlers.")*

**Definition of Done**
- [ ] `OperationHandler` interface is defined.
- [ ] Concrete handlers for `insert`, `delete`, and `undo` are created.
- [ ] The `hub.go` `run()` method is refactored to use the new handlers.
- [ ] All existing tests pass.
- [ ] The system's behavior is identical to the user from before the refactor.
